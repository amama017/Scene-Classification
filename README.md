# Scene-Classification
Scene Recognition using Spatial Pyramid Matching over Bag of Words Model

we discuss the methodology and results we worked on to solve the problem if recognizing the semantic category of an image as described in the project description, using Spatial Pyramid matching adapted from pyramid matching scheme of Grauman and Darrell over basic bag of words representation, in the presence of occlusion, shadows and cluttering. The system is implemented in C++ program on Linux system using OpenCV library for computer vision operations.
